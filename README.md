# Goat Aggressive Behavior Dataset

This dataset contains images with keypoint annotations, primarily used for goat behavior research. The keypoints are annotated in YOLOv8 format, suitable for pose estimation and behavior recognition tasks.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes:
- **Images**: Images contain various goat behaviors, such as standing, lying down, scratching, etc., saved in standard image formats (e.g., `.jpg`, `.png`).
- **Annotations**: Keypoint data for each image is provided in YOLOv8 format. Each keypoint corresponds to a specific body part of the goat, such as the head, body, and limbs.
